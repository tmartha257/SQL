#In this project I utilized a database with multiple tables to query statistics about customer and order information.

#I wrote this query to find out how many orders where placed in the month of January:
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#This query shows how many orders were placed for an iPhone:
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#The query below shows all of the customer account numbers for all of the orders
placed in the month of February:
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#I created the query below which returns the data of the cheapest product
in the month of January while showing the price of that item:
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#This query calculated the total revenue for each product in the month of January:
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#This query locates the product, the quantity of that item sold and the total
revenue that product sent to the address: 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101:
SELECT
SUM(quantity)
,product
,SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#This query shows the amount of customers that ordered more than 2 products in the 
month of February and the average amount they spent:
SELECT
count (distinct cust.acctnum)
,avg(quantity)*price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#This query returns a list of all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold:
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
