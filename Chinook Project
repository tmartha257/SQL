#In this project I utilized a database, "chinook", which contains 11 different tables, including information on albums, employees, customers, etc.
#I came up with questions I had about the database and used queries below that would return information I needed.

#This query shows the albums that are by the band "The Smashing Pumpkins":
SELECT Name, Title
FROM chinook.artists artists
JOIN chinook.albums albums
ON artists.ArtistId=albums.ArtistId
WHERE Name='Smashing Pumpkins';

#I wrote this query that shows all tracks that belong to the 'Alternative & Punk' genre:
SELECT tracks.Name as track, genres.Name as genre
FROM chinook.tracks tracks
JOIN chinook.genres genres
ON tracks.GenreId=genres.GenreId
WHERE genres.Name='Alternative & Punk';

#I created this query shows which employee assisted the customer, Martha Silk, with her purchase:
SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, employees.LastName, employees.FirstName
FROM chinook.customers customers
JOIN chinook.employees employees
ON employees.EmployeeId=customers.SupportRepId
WHERE customers.FirstName='Martha'
AND customers.LastName= 'Silk';

#This query shows the total invoices made in 2012:
SELECT COUNT(*) as invoice_totals
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2012-01-01' AND '2012-12-31';

#This query shows which sales agent made the most dollars in 2012:
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2012%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;

#I wrote this query that returns data on all the tracks, album names, and genres in the chinook database:
SELECT genres.Name as genre,
tracks.Name as track,
albums.Title as album
FROM chinook.genres genres
JOIN chinook.tracks tracks
ON genres.GenreId=tracks.GenreId
JOIN chinook.albums albums
ON albums.AlbumId=tracks.AlbumId;

#I created this query that returns data from the "customers" table, showing me the different countries that orders were placed from in alphabetical order:
SELECT distinct Country
FROM chinook.customers
ORDER BY Country asc;

#This query returns data of the first and last name of customers who placed orders from the USA:
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country='USA';

#This query shows which employee has been with the company the longest and their hire date:
SELECT FirstName, LastName,HireDate
FROM chinook.employees
ORDER BY HireDate asc
LIMIT 1;

#This query shows employees who have the title of "IT Staff":
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title='IT Staff';
